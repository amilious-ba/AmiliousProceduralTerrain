## Key Features

* Heat and moisture based biomes - biomes are generated using a heat and moisture noise.
* Biome based height maps - each biome can use a unique noise for precedural generation.
* Biome Blending - biomes are blended together
* Ocean/Land noise - you can use a unique noise algorithm for deciding what is land and what is an ocean.

## How To Use

This repository is a complete unity project.  In the future, I will release this as a free asset on the asset store.  This project is built using the odin inspector asset.  The asset should be added to the project in order for it to work properly.

## What Is This For

This project is being created for use in my game Eidreven.

## Credits

This project was build using several other pojects for noise generation or as insperation:
