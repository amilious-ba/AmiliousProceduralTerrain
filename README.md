## Key Features

* Heat and moisture based biomes - biomes are generated using a heat and moisture noise.
* Biome based height maps - each biome can use a unique noise for precedural generation.
* Biome Blending - biomes are blended together
* Ocean/Land noise - you can use a unique noise algorithm for deciding what is land and what is an ocean.

## How To Use

This repository is a complete unity project.  In the future, I may make this public and uploaded as an
asset instead of an entire project.

## What Is This For

This project is being created for use in my game Eidreven.

## Credits
