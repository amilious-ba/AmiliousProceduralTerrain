    heading: About
    text: Amilious Procedural Terrain is a side project produced for use in the game
      Eidreven.  We needed a flexible generated and chunked terrain which led to
      the production of Amilious Procedural Terrain.  This library is unique, but
      it includes many other works and tutorials that you can find online.  We combined
      the features that we felt were most useful.
